After you create an account on github and I add you as a collaborator on the project, you'll have full access to the code and you will be able to edit stuff yourself!

1. Download and install git. I got it from here: http://git.or.cz/#download
2. Create local repository for the code on your system from the current online one
	- use the "git clone" command
		- git clone REPO PATH
			- the repository (repo) for this project is git://github.com/Spartan97/tjgamesssbds.git
			- the path is the path to wherever you want the local folder to be (declare a new folder in the path)
	- Note: This might take a few minutes to finish, depending on how much is in the repo and your internet connection

Now you can start editing the code, but here are a few basic things to do.

- Before starting your edits each time, you want to synch your local repository with the online one.
	- To do this, cd into your local repository and type git pull REPO
		- once again, the repo is git://github.com/Spartan97/tjgamesssbds.git

- When you are done editing, it's important that you upload your edits online so that others can see and build off of them
	- This is a two-step process.
		- First, type git commit -a -m 'MESSAGE'
			- the message should be a short description of what your edits are. There is a character limit, I think it's 256.
		- Then type git push to add your updates and message to the online repo

Make sure you remember to pull and push, because otherwise some edits can get lost in the shuffle.

Have fun!!!

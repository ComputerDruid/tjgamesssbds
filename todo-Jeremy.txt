Next To Do:
- Teching (Yes, I'm that awesome)
- Animate match start countdown
- clean up fighter class

Major Goals - Things that break the balance/memory of the game or new features that I want to add, probably before release:
- Clashing hits
- Convert all gfx to FAT
- split minimap.cpp to a .h file (the "correct" way)
- replay system
- use 1 method to replace acting methods (Fighter::ftilt, Fighter::dtilt, etc)
- Improve LAN (projectiles, effects, minimaps, pausing, matches, etc)
- New stage select tiles
- "Random stage" button
- Improve Fox palettes
- Improve options menu (make like other menus, not PA_Text)

Minor Goals - Things that work fine but I'd like to improve:
- Skinnable menus
- Opening video/animation
- Offload some methods from main to global
	- class for custom controls
	- class for screen functions (scroll, fade, flash)
- custom respawn platforms
- kirby hats (functionality to bneut)
- secondary continue buttons to menus (have both button and touch for all menus)

Ongoing Goals - Things that will never be complete, but still need to be worked on:
- Better AI
- Balancing
- More Characters/Stages/MP3s/SFX

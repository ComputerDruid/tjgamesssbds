Major Goals - Things that break the balance/memory of the game or new features that I want to add, probably before release:
- LAN
- Clashing hits
- Convert all gfx to FAT
- split minimap.cpp to a .h file (the "correct" way)
- replay system
- use 1 method to replace acting methods (Fighter::ftilt, Fighter::dtilt, etc)
- credits for stage images

Minor Goals - Things that work fine but I'd like to improve:
- Skinnable menus
- more SFX
- Opening video/animation
- Offload some methods from main to global
	- class for custom controls
	- class for screen functions (scroll, fade, flash)
- Fox's lasers (multiple projectile sprites per char)
- quieter SFX (or louder music)
- better (more functional) pause menu
- custom respawn platforms

Ongoing Goals - Things that will never be complete, but still need to be worked on:
- Better AI
- Balancing
- More Characters/stages

Bugs - Things that are broken because of bad code:
- Sloped Stages don't work
- AI Bups are glitchy
- FAT sprites don't show on emulator
- Sometimes freezes after results screen
- Memory shortages (and leaks)
